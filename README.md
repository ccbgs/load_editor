load_editor
===========

Load worpress editor via ajax


This is a simple plugin meant to do the following:

1. Load the page template "template.php" instead of the theme template

2. Create a worpress editor with wp_editor

3. Load an unlimited amount of wordpress editors on the fly via ajax


This is meant to be an expample and not a finished product.

It currently on loads one editor via ajax that works (although the tabs do not work).

Anything added after the first editor doesn't work yet.
